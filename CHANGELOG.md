## Unreleased

### Added

- Added the MQTT Bridge driver for bridging Control4 devices to MQTT. This
  allows external systems like Home Assistant to monitor and control C4 devices.
  Currently supports lights/dimmers with features including:
    - Real-time state publishing as devices change
    - Command handling for external control
    - Device metadata (name, room, type) for easy integration
    - Retained messages for state persistence

## v20260217 - 2026-02-17

### Changed

- Broker properties (Automatic Updates, Update Channel) now automatically sync
  across all MQTT Broker driver instances.
- Temperature conversions (Fahrenheit/Celsius) now use single decimal precision
  instead of rounding to the nearest integer or half degree.

### Fixed

- Fixed variable restore order during driver initialization on controller
  reboot.

## v20260120 - 2026-01-27

### Fixed

- Fixed incorrect DriverCentral product ID in MQTT Universal driver.

## v20260120 - 2026-01-20

### Fixed

- Fixed consumer bindings (e.g., BUTTON_LINK for Event entities) not restoring
  their connections on controller reboot. The bindings module now tracks
  connection info and automatically re-establishes consumer binding connections
  when bindings are restored.

## v20260119 - 2026-01-19

### Added

- Added Event entity type to MQTT Universal driver for receiving MQTT events and
  triggering Control4 buttons/keypads.

### Changed

  and conditionals.
- Updated MQTT Universal documentation to include missing read-only properties
  and BUTTON_LINK binding information.

### Removed

- Removed deprecated MQTT Switch, MQTT Contact, and MQTT Button drivers.

## v20260117 - 2026-01-17

### Added

- Added the MQTT Universal driver for managing multiple MQTT devices from a
  single driver instance. Supports relays, contacts, buttons, variables, and
  sensors with features including:
  - Keypad button linking for MQTT buttons
  - Device availability conditionals and events
  - State variables for relay and contact items
  - JSONPath value extraction for complex JSON payloads
- Added "Broker Connected" conditional and events to the MQTT Broker driver.

### Deprecated

- Deprecated the MQTT Switch, MQTT Contact, and MQTT Button drivers. Use MQTT
  Universal instead. This is the terminal release for these drivers.
